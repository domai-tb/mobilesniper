<h3 align="center">A 5G mobile network penetration testing tool.</h3>

Pentest-5GSec provides a comprehensive guide to performing penetration testing on 5G networks, especially in campus environments. 

While 5G technology is driving advances in areas such as IoT, autonomous systems, and smart cities, its complex, virtualized, and open architecture also brings new security risks. 

[The guide](https://github.com/awareseven/5G-PentestGuide) describes methods for identifying vulnerabilities in key 5G components such as the Radio Access Network (RAN), Core Network and User Equipment (UE), addressing new threats such as protocol manipulation and denial of service attacks. It also emphasizes the importance of securing innovations such as network slicing and edge computing. 

By combining academic research and practical tools, the project provides a valuable resource to ensure the security and resilience of 5G infrastructures to growing threats. 

[The guide](https://github.com/lord-r3/pentest5gsec) is open source and can be further developed and used. We are happy to accept changes and additions via pull request. [The guide](https://github.com/awareseven/5G-PentestGuide) is available as a Gitbook.

The identified threats can be integrated into MITRE ATT&CK Workbench via the following [repository](https://github.com/awareseven/5g-threats)
